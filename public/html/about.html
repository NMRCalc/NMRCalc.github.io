        <p class="text-justify"><strong>NMRCalc</strong> is a simple calculator whose purpose is to calculate noise properties of the most sensitive part of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy system from the aspect of noise – its receiving (or probe-spectrometer) chain.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Its foundation is a noise-figure-based model of the NMR spectroscopy system's receiving chain, published in the summer of 2019 (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/14/3064">link</a>).</p>

        <p class="text-justify">The purpose of this calculator is to predict measurement results of a wanted NMR sample, and with measurement setup parameters of the user's NMR laboratory. Instead of performing an exhausting amount of measurements with different measurement setups, until optimal measurement setup is determined, and then actually measuring the wanted NMR sample (nowadays, very often, this consumes unenviable amounts of time), one can use this calculator to theoretically predict the optimal measurement setup parameters, as well as the NMR measurements results (this consumes only a few minutes of your time).</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><strong>NMRCalc</strong> is the result of a scientific research that spawned one successfully defended PhD thesis (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5nfcuaydg0xnamj/Petar_Kolar_PhD_Thesis.pdf?dl=0">link</a>) and one very relieved former PhD student, who is now a (relatively) happy Doctor of Philosophy. Hopefully, the use of NMRCalc will help create more new and happy Doctors of Philosophy and produce some new, useful and exciting results in various scientific research.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">If you’re thirsty for more information, you can find what you crave under the "Publications" tab on this website’s start screen. In case of any questions, suggestions or praises in the process, please don’t hesitate to send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:nmrcalc@gmail.com">nmrcalc@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Good luck!</p>
